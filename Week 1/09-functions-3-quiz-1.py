Build a quiz program  This program is in two parts.

Part 1) Generate the quiz based on user input.  Complete part 1 first and then move on to part 2.

The program will ask the user for a question and an answer and store that information.

E.g. "What is the only island in the Caribbean to have a railroad?", "Cuba"

Decide whether you want to store this information in an array or a hash.

The app should ask for 2 sets of questions and answers.

An example run would be:

Program: Enter the question text for question 1: 

User: What's the Only Fruit to Have its Seeds on the Outside?

Program: Enter the answer text for question 1:

User: strawberries

Program: Enter the question text for question 2: 

User: What's the blah?

Program: Enter the answer text for question 2:

User: blah

Now you store that pair of information, and ask the user for question 2.

Store both those pieces of information in one variable and return it.

Keep in mind that in the future you could have to store way more then two question/answer pairs

Part 2)

Write code that takes the data structure returned from the function in part one and quizzes the user.

Example Run:

Program: Question 1: What is the capital of Germany? 

User: Berlin

Program: Correct!

Program: Question 2: How many cards are there in a standard deck of playing cards?

User: 51

Program: Wrong!
